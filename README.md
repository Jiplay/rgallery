## About

rgallery unifies your photo and video collection into a single, elegant web interfaceâ€”complete with a timeline view, memories, favorites, folders, EXIF metadata, map view, and more. To get started, see [Deploy with Docker](#docker) or [visit the docs](https://rgallery.app/docs/) for more information.

rgallery was originally designed for photographer's with highly organized photo collections, but adapts to all photo and video collections, even if they are not well organized.

## Features

### Explore your photo and video library

- Timeline view: Scroll to any date in your library, all in a single view grouped by day. Filter by folder, tag, camera, lens, and other metadata.
- Search everything: Search metadata across all your images and videos.
- Map view: Explore your geo-tagged memories across the world.
- Reverse geocoding: Tag media items with cities and countries from EXIF coordinates without external API calls.
- Infinite slider: Swipe through your media library until the very end, effortlessly.
- Permalinks: Every image and video gets a unique, persistent URL.
- Folder view: A recursive look into your library's folder structure.
- Metadata at a glance: View detailed EXIF metadata for all media items.
- Dark mode.
- Memories: Revisit relevant events that happened "on this day."
- Gear stats: Analyze your media collection by camera, lens, focal length, and more. Have multiple cameras that record different EXIF tags for the same lens? Use [lens aliases](#lens-aliases) to view them together.

## Get started

### Deploy with docker

In a terminal, configure the path to your media files and run the following command:

```shell
docker run \
  -v /path-to-your-media-files:/media:ro \
  -v ./data:/data \
  -v ./cache:/cache \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  robbymilo/rgallery:latest
```

The following volume is required for rgallery to access your media files:

- path to your media files: `/path-to-your-media-files:/media:ro`

The following volumes are required to persist the database and image thumbnail cache:

- path to the database directory: `./data:/data`
- path to the cache directory: `./cache:/cache`

If they are unchanged the data and cache directories will be created in the current directory where the command is run.

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The default username and password are both **admin**.
