## Overview

rgallery is an open source, self-hostable, and offline-first application that scans your media library and publishes a single web interface with a timeline view, memories, maps, and more.

rgallery was originally meant for photographer's with highly organized photo collections, however it adapts to all photo and video collections, even those that are not well organized.

rgallery is designed with simplicity, privacy, and stability in mind. Visit [user-interface](/docs/get-started/user-interface/) for screenshots of the application.
