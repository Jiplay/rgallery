# Backup rgallery

It is recommended to backup your rgallery database.

In the event of data loss, you can rescan your media library to re-import your media items. However your users and API keys will be lost.

<!-- There are two recommended methods for backing up rgallery: -->

- [Backup and restore rgallery with SQLite](/docs/backup/sqlite/)
<!-- - [Continuously replicate rgallery with Litestream](/docs/backup/litestream/) -->
